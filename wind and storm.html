            <h2>SOLAR WIND</h2>
            <p>
                        Solar wind is a continuous stream of charged particles, primarily electrons and protons,
                        that are ejected from the outermost layer of the Sun's atmosphere, known as the solar corona. These charged particles travel through space at varying speeds,
                        carrying with them magnetic fields from the Sun. Solar wind is a constant and pervasive flow of particles and magnetic fields that extends throughout the solar system,
                        influencing the space environment around it.

            <h2>GEOMAGNETIC STORM</h2>
            <p>
                Geomagnetic storms are disturbances in Earth's magnetic field 
                caused by interactions between the solar wind and our planet's 
                magnetosphere, which is the region of space surrounding Earth dominated 
                by its magnetic field.<br>
               <br>Geomagnetic storms are a natural consequence of the Sun's activity,
                 which follows an 11-year solar cycle. During periods of high solar activity, 
                 the likelihood of geomagnetic storms increases. 
                 Scientists monitor the Sun and the solar wind to provide warnings and prepare for potential impacts on Earth's technological infrastructure during periods of heightened solar activity.

            <h2>OUR MODEL</h2>
            <p>
                Our model works to predict the time of geomagnetic storm 
                occurrence and determine its intensity on the kp scale
